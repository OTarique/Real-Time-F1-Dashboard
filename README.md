# Introduction

A work in progress real time F1 dashboard that displays scoreboard, race control messages, race updates and other metrics. It uses the live-timing data F1 broadcasts to the SignalR protocol. 

The initial script that communicates with the live-timing SignalR server was taken from [iebb's PixooLiveTiming repo](https://github.com/iebb/PixooLiveTiming). I have edited the script to pull other data and manipulate it as necessary to display on a [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) dashboard.

Below is video of the dashboard in action:
